# A Point Cloud Completion Approach for the Grasping of Partially Occluded Objects and Its Applications in Robotic Strawberry Harvesting

1. Collecting sim data from IsaacSim strawberry field setup
2. Collecting real dataset from an indoor strawberry field
3. Train modified PointAttn using real+sim datasets **PointAttN-Modified/PointAttN-Modified_main/models/PointAttN.py**
4. Send topics to MoveIt to test grasping
5. Deploy on robotic arm using Nvidia Jetson Orin
